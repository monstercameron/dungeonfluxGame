# Browser client architecture

Date: 2026-09-29
Status: Client roles and authority agreed; concrete interface/API plan added, implementation pending

## Agreed direction

DungeonFlux is a browser game with two primary client roles connected to the same
game session:

| Role | Device targets | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared display | TV, laptop screen, or laptop connected to a TV | Present the game to the group |
| Player client | Mobile phone, laptop, or tablet | Display the player's view and send player input |

A client role is independent of device type. A laptop can provide the shared
display or a player client. Player interfaces must accommodate different screen
sizes and touch, mouse, and keyboard input as appropriate.

## Implementation language

The application is full-stack Rust: native Rust on the backend and Rust compiled
to WebAssembly for browser clients. Do not introduce Go, JavaScript, or TypeScript
application code. Frameworks and rendering libraries remain to be selected.

Generated JavaScript glue for WebAssembly loading and browser API access is
allowed. Application logic and UI source remain Rust; this exception does not
permit handwritten JavaScript or TypeScript application code. See the
[official wasm-bindgen browser example](https://wasm-bindgen.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/without-a-bundler.html).

Subsystems are separate Rust crates as described in
[Subsystem architecture](subsystem-architecture.md).
[Subsystem interfaces](subsystem-interfaces.md) and [RPC API](rpc-api.md) now define
the planned boundaries. Resolve applicable gates and freeze types before consumers.

DungeonFlux must support the standard 2024 fifth-edition D&D rules. Precise
source/catalog pinning remains a gate; see [Rules support](rules-support.md) and
[Rules coverage](rules-coverage.md) for the planned families and completion criteria.

Observability is a core design requirement across both client roles and backend
subsystems. See [Observability](observability.md) for the shared ports, RPC/query
shapes and remaining implementation gates.

PostgreSQL stores durable gameplay data. OpenTelemetry runtime logs and correlated
spans go to a separate SQLite database for agent review; the SQLite development
queue/devlog remains separate. See [Storage architecture](storage-architecture.md).

Structured client/server game communication uses RPC through the planned Rust
port of the gRPC-over-WebSocket bridge. See [RPC transport](rpc-transport.md) for
the full streaming requirement, latency goals, and browser feasibility gate.

## Agreed division of responsibilities

The server owns the game: authoritative session state, D&D rules resolution,
dice outcomes, action validation, progression, and AI/media orchestration. It
determines the appropriate view and audio for each connected client role.

Clients are thin Rust/WebAssembly presentation applications. They render
server-provided views and play server-provided audio. Player clients collect input
and send action requests to the server; submitting an action does not resolve it
locally. The shared display presents the group's view, while player clients show
their permitted personal views. The server must filter private information before
sending it, rather than relying on the client to hide it.

Client state is limited to presentation and connection needs, such as focus,
layout, view revisions, audio buffers, and loading indicators. Clients do not own
game state or duplicate the rules engine. Local rendering and audio decoding are
presentation work; game decisions remain server responsibilities.

Both roles must stay mounted through ordinary updates, navigation and reconnect,
without full-page reloads. Program presentation through reusable Rust components
and typed, bounded server-provided presentation variants/timelines; preserve smooth
interruptible motion, valid local focus/drafts and resource lifetimes. Read
[Client presentation](client-presentation.md) for the programming model, update
lifecycle, animation/recovery contract and measured browser acceptance gates.

Reconnecting clients recover the current permitted view from the server. The new
interface/API plan covers view shapes, ordering, audio timelines and async jobs;
concrete protobuf types, browser transport/codec implementation and device budgets
are prerequisites in [Implementation roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md).

That planning must cover the [runtime reliability requirements](runtime-reliability.md):
confirmed action results, initial/updated/reconnected views, timing, audio
cancellation and playback, and private player projections. The first integrated
slice must run through both client roles in a real browser, including a rejected
action and reconnect. Choose a supported-device matrix before claiming compatibility;
desktop automation alone does not prove phone sleep/network or audio behavior.

## Decisions still open

- Rust frontend/backend frameworks, rendering, and RPC bridge implementation.
- Concrete credential bootstrap/persistence, configured player limits, and
  deployment account policy; session/join/resume/binding semantics are now planned.
- Detailed host-panel layout; host is a capability attached to an authorized
  player/display client, not a mandatory third device role.
- Supported browsers, including whether direct smart-TV browsing is required.
- Shared-display layout, responsive player layouts, and server-controlled audio
  routing and synchronization.
- Exact rulebook/content catalog, launch campaign, PostgreSQL physical schemas,
  and durable media deployment; interfaces/recovery semantics are now planned.

Agents must reference this document for client roles and device targets. Proposals
and open decisions above must not be treated as approved implementation contracts.
