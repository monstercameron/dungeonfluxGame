//! C-df-types-BOUNDARY candidate contract source, consumed only by contract fixtures.
//! The production df-types API and all wire/storage representations remain unchanged.
//! Construction preserves supplied values; it never issues identity or establishes access.
//!
//! One producer/consumer ledger (request -> result/error; resource owner):
//! - Session/member/binding/run/operation: canonical df-types byte/text constructors ->
//!   their distinct values / IdentityError or TextIdentityError. Actual consumers are
//!   df-api::request, df-auth/session scoped inputs, df-model::checkpoint::Basis and
//!   membership, and generated common DTO mappings in df-tools/tests/shared_contracts.
//! - Client: this candidate ClientId is one supplied client instance identity, distinct
//!   from stable ClientBindingId and the actual opaque df-client ConnectionGeneration.
//!   Candidate association is ClientId + ClientBindingId + current connection token;
//!   allocation/credential/wire ingestion still belongs to client/session/auth owners.
//! - Job: reuse df-model::checkpoint::JobId and its canonical byte validator. Actual
//!   RequestIdentity and SpeechIdentity bind Basis + JobId + OperationId + generation.
//! - Utterance: this candidate UtteranceId associates one utterance with an admitted
//!   JobId and its exact session/run/operation/generation; it is not an alias for JobId.
//!   SpeechScheduler remains the actual response owner; no speech wire tag is invented.
//! - Asset: this candidate AssetId is distinct from AssetReference.key and content digest.
//!   Candidate association retains the entire actual AssetReference. AssetResolver::new
//!   and open_native consume that reference, current caller/purpose/basis and ByteRange.
//!   AssetReadAuthority owns access; a hash, AssetId or verified backing is not permission.
//! - Revision: canonical RecoveryEpoch/SessionRevision -> RevisionError; checked sequence
//!   never advances an epoch. Persistence owns protected epoch issuance and recovery.
//! - Work generation: this candidate nonzero Generation -> GenerationError; advance is
//!   checked. Its run/job/operation/owner scope is mandatory at native completion. It
//!   does not replace pointer-identity ConnectionGeneration or manufacture owner authority.
//! - Money/Usage: canonical Currency/Money/Usage/LiabilityRate -> MoneyError; exact u128
//!   tagged micro-units and closed usage units. Commerce/provider owns quotes/settlement.
//! - Locale: canonical LocaleTag::parse -> LocaleTagError; locale owner settles/falls back.
//! - Ruleset: candidate RulesetId stores separate mechanics/catalog/source-manifest labels
//!   -> component-attributed RevisionLabelError. The actual RulesPins association retains
//!   mode, all digests and handler identity. Syntax is not catalog/source/rights approval.
//! - Build: canonical BuildIdentity::new -> BuildIdentityError; independent source/native/
//!   WASM/configuration/content labels. Build/content owners supply and verify artifacts.
//!
//! All above values own only ordinary Rust value memory; none owns a stream or task.
//! Actual consumer resource/terminal contracts and required fixture hooks:
//! - RpcConnection owns CallCancellation waits and RpcStream admission. Close/drop fences
//!   its ConnectionGeneration and releases only local waits; statuses/EOF/trailers stay
//!   distinct and cannot acknowledge a game mutation. Fixture: types_boundary client case;
//!   existing df-client contract tests cover returned streams, capacity and terminal status.
//! - AuthorizedRange privately owns the verified reader, rechecks current authorization
//!   before each bounded chunk, terminates on typed RangeError and drops its reader.
//!   Asset publication distinguishes MetadataFailure::Unknown from confirmed receipts.
//!   Fixture: types_boundary asset case plus existing df-assets publication/range/resolution.
//! - SpeechScheduler owns counted request/chunk buffers until finish/stop/owner teardown;
//!   dropping SpeechReceipt does not cancel admitted work. MediaLifecycle checks owner
//!   identity, operation, generation and scene before publication. Existing df-media
//!   speech/cancellation suites are the actual typed failure/owned-cleanup fixture hooks.
//! - CheckedRequest owns admitted bounded bytes; provider request/context identity is
//!   checked before use. Existing df-provider-api request suites are the actual hooks.
//!
//! Native consumer fixtures are excluded on WASM; candidate/value tests compile on both.
//! No new dependency edge, production export, codec, service, issuer or resource owner is
//! declared here. Later implementation must reuse these candidates through its own gate.
