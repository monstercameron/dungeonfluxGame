//! Bounded decoded presentation resources, separate from production playback.
//!
//! The queue owns PCM and preserves supplied frame offsets. Canonical media identities,
//! output leases and immutable asset references do not authorize audio by themselves.
//! No provider bytes, decoder, browser node or game rule is implemented here.
//! A mounted playback adapter must stop its actual nodes before confirming stop,
//! and explicitly dispose this owner before unmounting. Queue callbacks report
//! resource lifetime facts; they never attest that a speaker was audible.
